# Simplified and efficient scaling of AI/ML on the Hybrid Cloud

CodeFlare provides a simple, user-friendly abstraction for developing, scaling, and managing resources for distributed AI/ML on the Hybrid Cloud platform with OpenShift Container Platform.

It consists of the following main components:

* **Simplified user experience**:
CodeFlare [SDK](codeflare-sdk) and [CLI](codeflare-cli) to define, develop, and control remote distributed compute jobs and infrastructure from either a python-based environment or command-line interface

* **Efficient resource management**:
Multi-Cluster Application Dispatcher [(MCAD)](mcad) for queueing, resource quotas, and management of batch jobs. And, Instascale, for on-demand resource scaling of an OpenShift cluster

* **Automated and streamlined deployment**:
[CodeFlare Operator](codeflare-operator) for automating deployment and configuration of the Project CodeFlare stack

With CodeFlare stack, users automate and simplify scale-out of steps like data pre-processing, distributed model training, adaptation and validation. 

Through transparent integration with [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) and [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) framewokrs, and the rich library ecosystem that run on them, CodeFlare enables data scientists to **spend more time on model developement and minimum time on resource deployment and scaling**. 

See the CodeFlare stack below and how to get started.

## Project CodeFlare Ecosystem

In addition to running standalone, Project CodeFlare is deployed as part of and integrated with the [Open Data Hub][distributed-workloads], leveraging [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com). 

With OpenShift can be deployed anywhere, from on-prem to cloud, and integrate easily with other cloud-native ecosystems.

## Getting Started

### Learning

Watch [this video][youtube-demo] for an introduction to Project CodeFlare and what the
stack can do.
