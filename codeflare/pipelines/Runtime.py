"""codeflare.pipelines.Runtime
This class is the core runtime for CodeFlare pipelines. It provides the entry point for execution of the
pipeline that was constructed from codeflare.pipelines.Datamodel. The key entry point is the basic
execute_pipeline, with other enhanced entry points such as cross_validate and grid_search_cv.

The other methods provide supporting functions for execution of pipeline primitives. In addition to this,
methods for selecting a pipeline are provided as well as saving a specific pipeline instance along with
that pipeline's state.

Details on the execution and parallelism exposed are provided in the design documentation.

    """
    A top-level method that does a grid search with cross validation. This method takes pipeline, the input to it,
    a set of parameters for the pipeline, and a cross validator similar to the traditional GridSearchCV of sklearn
    and executes the various pipelines and cross validation in parallel.

    This method will first transform the input pipeline and expand it to perform a parameter grid search and then
    the cross validator is run in parallel. The goal is to execute each of the cross validation for each of the
    parameter combination in parallel to provide the results.

    The results are captured in a dict that maps each pipeline to its corresponding cross validation scores.
